Here’s why I believe next year is an opportunity to shape the world’s next chapter for the better.\n","For me, this will always be the year I became a\n","grandparent. It will be the year I spent a lot of precious\n","time with loved ones—whether on the pickleball court\n","or over a rousing game of Settlers of Catan. And\n","2023 marked the first time I used artificial intelligence\n","for work and other serious reasons, not just to mess\n","around and create parody song lyrics for my friends.\n","This year gave us a glimpse of how AI will shape the\n","future, and as 2023 comes to a close, I’m thinking\n","more than ever about the world today’s young people\n","will inherit. In last year’s letter, I wrote about how the\n","prospect of becoming a grandparent made me reflect\n","on the world my granddaughter will be born into.\n","Now I’m thinking more about the world she will inherit\n","and what it will be like decades from now, when her\n","generation is in charge.\n","I can begin to picture it: the tools she will use, the\n","ways she will stay in touch with her loved ones, the\n","problems these innovations will help solve. We now\n","have a better sense of what types of jobs AI will be\n","able to do by itself and which ones it will serve as\n","a copilot for. And it’s clearer than ever how AI can\n","be used to improve access to education, mental\n","health, and more. It motivates me to make sure this\n","technology helps reduce—and doesn’t contribute\n","to—the awful inequities we see around the world. I’ve\n","always been a firm believer in the power of innovation\n","to offer every child an equal chance to survive and\n","thrive. AI is no exception.\n","The early years of a new age are often marked by\n","lots of changes. If you are old enough to remember,\n","think back to the beginning of the internet. At first, you\n","probably didn’t know many people who were using\n","it. But it became more common over time until, one\n","day, you realized most people had email addresses,\n","bought things online, and used search engines to\n","answer their questions.\n","\n","In my lifetime, I’ve seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary.\n","\n","The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.\n","\n","The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.\n","\n","I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They finished it in just a few months.\n","\n","In September, when I met with them again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT, their AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got 59 of them right. Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended questions from the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got a 5—the highest possible score, and the equivalent to getting an A or A+ in a college-level biology course.\n","\n","Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given. The whole experience was stunning.\n","\n","I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.\n","\n","This inspired me to think about all the things that AI can achieve in the next five to 10 years.\n","\n","The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.\n","\n","Philanthropy is my full-time job these days, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how—in addition to helping people be more productive—AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities. Globally, the worst inequity is in health: 5 million children under the age of 5 die every year. That’s down from 10 million two decades ago, but it’s still a shockingly high number. Nearly all of these children were born in poor countries and die of preventable causes like diarrhea or malaria. It’s hard to imagine a better use of AIs than saving the lives of children.\n","\n","I’ve been thinking a lot about how AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.\n","\n","In the United States, the best opportunity for reducing inequity is to improve education, particularly making sure that students succeed at math. The evidence shows that having basic math skills sets students up for success, no matter what career they choose. But achievement in math is going down across the country, especially for Black, Latino, and low-income students. AI can help turn that trend around.\n","\n","Climate change is another issue where I’m convinced AI can make the world more equitable. The injustice of climate change is that the people who are suffering the most—the world’s poorest—are also the ones who did the least to contribute to the problem. I’m still thinking and learning about how AI can help, but later in this post I’ll suggest a few areas with a lot of potential.\n","\n","In short, I'm excited about the impact that AI will have on issues that the Gates Foundation works on, and the foundation will have much more to say about AI in the coming months. The world needs to make sure that everyone—and not just people who are well-off—benefits from artificial intelligence. Governments and philanthropy will need to play a major role in ensuring that it reduces inequity and doesn’t contribute to it. This is the priority for my own work related to AI.\n","\n","Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence. I understand why—it raises hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias, and more. AIs also make factual mistakes and experience hallucinations. Before I suggest some ways to mitigate the risks, I’ll define what I mean by AI, and I’ll go into more detail about some of the ways in which it will help empower people at work, save lives, and improve education.\n","\n","Defining artificial intelligence\n","Technically, the term artificial intelligence refers to a model created to solve a specific problem or provide a particular service. What is powering things like ChatGPT is artificial intelligence. It is learning how to do chat better but can’t learn other tasks. By contrast, the term artificial general intelligence refers to software that’s capable of learning any task or subject. AGI doesn’t exist yet—there is a robust debate going on in the computing industry about how to create it, and whether it can even be created at all.\n","\n","Developing AI and AGI has been the great dream of the computing industry. For decades, the question was when computers would be better than humans at something other than making calculations. Now, with the arrival of machine learning and large amounts of computing power, sophisticated AIs are a reality and they will get better very fast.\n","\n","I think back to the early days of the personal computing revolution, when the software industry was so small that most of us could fit onstage at a conference. Today it is a global industry. Since a huge portion of it is now turning its attention to AI, the innovations are going to come much faster than what we experienced after the microprocessor breakthrough. Soon the pre-AI period will seem as distant as the days when using a computer meant typing at a C:> prompt rather than tapping on a screen.\n","\n","Productivity enhancement\n","Although humans are still better than GPT at a lot of things, there are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much. For example, many of the tasks done by a person in sales (digital or phone), service, or document handling (like payables, accounting, or insurance claim disputes) require decision-making but not the ability to learn continuously. Corporations have training programs for these activities and in most cases, they have a lot of examples of good and bad work. Humans are trained using these data sets, and soon these data sets will also be used to train the AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.\n","\n","As computing power gets cheaper, GPT’s ability to express ideas will increasingly be like having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks. Microsoft describes this as having a co-pilot. Fully incorporated into products like Office, AI will enhance your work—for example by helping with writing emails and managing your inbox.\n","\n","Eventually your main way of controlling a computer will no longer be pointing and clicking or tapping on menus and dialogue boxes. Instead, you’ll be able to write a request in plain English. (And not just English—AIs will understand languages from around the world. In India earlier this year, I met with developers who are working on AIs that will understand many of the languages spoken there.)\n","\n","In addition, advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent. Think of it as a digital personal assistant: It will see your latest emails, know about the meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don’t want to bother with. This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do.\n","\n","Advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent.\n","\n","You’ll be able to use natural language to have this agent help you with scheduling, communications, and e-commerce, and it will work across all your devices. Because of the cost of training the models and running the computations, creating a personal agent is not feasible yet, but thanks to the recent advances in AI, it is now a realistic goal. Some issues will need to be worked out: For example, can an insurance company ask your agent things about you without your permission? If so, how many people will choose not to use it?\n","\n","Company-wide agents will empower employees in new ways. An agent that understands a particular company will be available for its employees to consult directly and should be part of every meeting so it can answer questions. It can be told to be passive or encouraged to speak up if it has some insight. It will need access to the sales, support, finance, product schedules, and text related to the company. It should read news related to the industry the company is in. I believe that the result will be that employees will become more productive.\n","\n","When productivity goes up, society benefits because people are freed up to do other things, at work and at home. Of course, there are serious questions about what kind of support and retraining people will need. Governments need to help workers transition into other roles. But the demand for people who help other people will never go away. The rise of AI will free people up to do things that software never will—teaching, caring for patients, and supporting the elderly, for example.\n","\n","Global health and education are two areas where there’s great need and not enough workers to meet those needs. These are areas where AI can help reduce inequity if it is properly targeted. These should be a key focus of AI work, so I will turn to them now.\n","\n","Health\n","I see several ways in which AIs will improve health care and the medical field.\n","\n","For one thing, they’ll help health-care workers make the most of their time by taking care of certain tasks for them—things like filing insurance claims, dealing with paperwork, and drafting notes from a doctor’s visit. I expect that there will be a lot of innovation in this area.\n","\n","Other AI-driven improvements will be especially important for poor countries, where the vast majority of under-5 deaths happen.\n","\n","For example, many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive. (The effort to develop AI-powered ultrasound machines that can be used with minimal training is a great example of this.) AIs will even give patients the ability to do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment.\n","\n","The AI models used in poor countries will need to be trained on different diseases than in rich countries. They will need to work in different languages and factor in different challenges, such as patients who live very far from clinics or can’t afford to stop working if they get sick.\n","\n","People will need to see evidence that health AIs are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes. AIs have to be tested very carefully and properly regulated, which means it will take longer for them to be adopted than in other areas. But then again, humans make mistakes too. And having no access to medical care is also a problem.\n","\n","In addition to helping with care, AIs will dramatically accelerate the rate of medical breakthroughs. The amount of data in biology is very large, and it’s hard for humans to keep track of all the ways that complex biological systems work. There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly. Some companies are working on cancer drugs that were developed this way.\n","\n","The next generation of tools will be much more efficient, and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels. One of the Gates Foundation’s priorities in AI is to make sure these tools are used for the health problems that affect the poorest people in the world, including AIDS, TB, and malaria.\n","\n","Similarly, governments and philanthropy should create incentives for companies to share AI-generated insights into crops or livestock raised by people in poor countries. AIs can help develop better seeds based on local conditions, advise farmers on the best seeds to plant based on the soil and weather in their area, and help develop drugs and vaccines for livestock. As extreme weather and climate change put even more pressure on subsistence farmers in low-income countries, these advances will be even more important.\n","\n","Education\n","Computers haven’t had the effect on education that many of us in the industry have hoped. There have been some good developments, including educational games and online sources of information like Wikipedia, but they haven’t had a meaningful effect on any of the measures of students’ achievement.\n","\n","But I think in the next five to 10 years, AI-driven software will finally deliver on the promise of revolutionizing the way people teach and learn. It will know your interests and your learning style so it can tailor content that will keep you engaged. It will measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to. It will give immediate feedback.\n","\n","There are many ways that AIs can assist teachers and administrators, including assessing a student’s understanding of a subject and giving advice on career planning. Teachers are already using tools like ChatGPT to provide comments on their students’ writing assignments.\n","\n","Of course, AIs will need a lot of training and further development before they can do things like understand how a certain student learns best or what motivates them. Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers. It will enhance—but never replace—the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.\n","\n","New tools will be created for schools that can afford to buy them, but we need to ensure that they are also created for and available to low-income schools in the U.S. and around the world. AIs will need to be trained on diverse data sets so they are unbiased and reflect the different cultures where they’ll be used. And the digital divide will need to be addressed so that students in low-income households do not get left behind.\n","\n","I know a lot of teachers are worried that students are using GPT to write their essays. Educators are already discussing ways to adapt to the new technology, and I suspect those conversations will continue for quite some time. I’ve heard about teachers who have found clever ways to incorporate the technology into their work—like by allowing students to use GPT to create a first draft that they have to personalize.\n","\n","Risks and problems with AI\n","You’ve probably read about problems with the current AI models. For example, they aren’t necessarily good at understanding the context for a human’s request, which leads to some strange results. When you ask an AI to make up something fictional, it can do that well. But when you ask for advice about a trip you want to take, it may suggest hotels that don’t exist. This is because the AI doesn’t understand the context for your request well enough to know whether it should invent fake hotels or only tell you about real ones that have rooms available.\n","\n","There are other issues, such as AIs giving wrong answers to math problems because they struggle with abstract reasoning. But none of these are fundamental limitations of artificial intelligence. Developers are working on them, and I think we’re going to see them largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.\n","\n","Other concerns are not simply technical. For example, there’s the threat posed by humans armed with AI. Like most inventions, artificial intelligence can be used for good purposes or malign ones. Governments need to work with the private sector on ways to limit the risks.\n","\n","Then there’s the possibility that AIs will run out of control. Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us? Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.\n","\n","Superintelligent AIs are in our future. Compared to a computer, our brains operate at a snail’s pace: An electrical signal in the brain moves at 1/100,000th the speed of the signal in a silicon chip! Once developers can generalize a learning algorithm and run it at the speed of a computer—an accomplishment that could be a decade away or a century away—we’ll have an incredibly powerful AGI. It will be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits on the size of its memory or the speed at which it operates. This will be a profound change.\n","\n","These “strong” AIs, as they’re known, will probably be able to establish their own goals. What will those goals be? What happens if they conflict with humanity’s interests? Should we try to prevent strong AI from ever being developed? These questions will get more pressing with time.\n","\n","But none of the breakthroughs of the past few months have moved us substantially closer to strong AI. Artificial intelligence still doesn’t control the physical world and can’t establish its own goals. A recent New York Times article about a conversation with ChatGPT where it declared it wanted to become a human got a lot of attention. It was a fascinating look at how human-like the model's expression of emotions can be, but it isn't an indicator of meaningful independence.\n","\n","Three books have shaped my own thinking on this subject: Superintelligence, by Nick Bostrom; Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark; and A Thousand Brains, by Jeff Hawkins. I don’t agree with everything the authors say, and they don’t agree with each other either. But all three books are well written and thought-provoking.\n","\n","The next frontiers\n","There will be an explosion of companies working on new uses of AI as well as ways to improve the technology itself. For example, companies are developing new chips that will provide the massive amounts of processing power needed for artificial intelligence. Some use optical switches—lasers, essentially—to reduce their energy consumption and lower the manufacturing cost. Ideally, innovative chips will allow you to run an AI on your own device, rather than in the cloud, as you have to do today.\n","\n","On the software side, the algorithms that drive an AI’s learning will get better. There will be certain domains, such as sales, where developers can make AIs extremely accurate by limiting the areas that they work in and giving them a lot of training data that’s specific to those areas. But one big open question is whether we’ll need many of these specialized AIs for different uses—one for education, say, and another for office productivity—or whether it will be possible to develop an artificial general intelligence that can learn any task. There will be immense competition on both approaches.\n","\n","No matter what, the subject of AIs will dominate the public discussion for the foreseeable future. I want to suggest three principles that should guide that conversation.\n","\n","First, we should try to balance fears about the downsides of AI—which are understandable and valid—with its ability to improve people’s lives. To make the most of this remarkable new technology, we’ll need to both guard against the risks and spread the benefits to as many people as possible.\n","\n","Second, market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest. The opposite is more likely. With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity. Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world’s best AIs on its biggest problems.\n","\n","Although we shouldn’t wait for this to happen, it’s interesting to think about whether artificial intelligence would ever identify inequity and try to reduce it. Do you need to have a sense of morality in order to see inequity, or would a purely rational AI also see it? If it did recognize inequity, what would it suggest that we do about it?\n","\n","Finally, we should keep in mind that we’re only at the beginning of what AI can accomplish. Whatever limitations it has today will be gone before we know it.\n","\n","I’m lucky to have been involved with the PC revolution and the Internet revolution. I’m just as excited about this moment. This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives. At the same time, the world needs to establish the rules of the road so that any downsides of artificial intelligence are far outweighed by its benefits, and so that everyone can enjoy those benefits no matter where they live or how much money they have. The Age of AI is filled with opportunities and responsibilities.\n","We are just at the beginning of this transition right\n","now. This is an exciting and confusing time, and if\n","By Bill Gates\n","I loved getting to know my new granddaughter this year.\n","The Year Ahead 2024 2\n","you haven’t figured out how to make the best use of\n","AI yet, you are not alone. I thought I would use AI\n","tools for the foundation’s strategy reviews this year,\n","which require reading hundreds of pages of briefing\n","materials that an AI could accurately summarize for\n","me. But old habits are hard to break, and I ended up\n","preparing for them the same way I always do.\n","Of course, AI is far from the only defining feature of\n","2023. Millions continue to experience unbearable\n","grief as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine and in the\n","aftermath of the war in Ethiopia.

But a key priority of the Gates Foundation in AI\n","is ensuring these tools also address health issues\n","that disproportionately affect the world’s poorest, like\n","AIDS, TB, and malaria.\n","We’re taking a hard look at the wide array of AI\n","innovation in the pipeline right now and working with\n","our partners to use these technologies to improve\n","lives in low- and middle-income countries.\n","In the fall, I traveled to Senegal to meet with some\n","of the incredible researchers doing this work and to\n","celebrate the 20th anniversary of the foundation’s\n","Grand Challenges initiative. When we first launched\n","Grand Challenges—the Gates Foundation’s flagship\n","innovation program—it had a single goal: Identify\n","the biggest problems in health and give grants to\n","local researchers who might solve them. We asked\n","innovators from developing countries how they would\n","address health challenges in their communities, and\n","then we gave them the support to make it happen.\n","Many of the people I met in Senegal were taking on\n","the first-ever AI Grand Challenge. The foundation\n","didn’t have AI projects in mind when we first set that\n","goal back in 2003, but I’m always inspired by how\n","brilliant scientists are able to take advantage of the\n","latest technology to tackle big problems.\n","Much of their work is in the earliest stages of\n","development—there’s a good chance we won’t\n","see any of them used widely in 2024 or even 2025.\n","Some might not even pan out at all. The work that\n","will be done over the next year is setting the stage\n","for a massive technology boom later this decade.\n","Still, it’s impressive to see how much creativity is\n","being brought to the table. Here is a small sample\n","of some of the most ambitious questions currently\n","being explored:\n","It was great to learn from Amrita Mahale about how the team at ARMMAN is\n","developing an AI chatbot to improve health outcomes for pregnant women.\n","The Year Ahead 2024 5\n","Can AI combat antibiotic resistance?\n","Antibiotics are magical in their ability to end infection,\n","but if you use them too often, pathogens can learn\n","how to ignore them. This is called antimicrobial\n","resistance, or AMR, and it is a huge issue around\n","the world—especially in Africa, which has the highest\n","mortality rates from AMR. Nana Kofi Quakyi from the\n","Aurum Institute in Ghana is working on an AI-powered\n","tool that helps health workers prescribe antibiotics\n","without contributing to AMR. The tool will comb\n","through all the available information—including local\n","clinical guidelines and health surveillance data about\n","which pathogens are currently at risk of developing\n","resistance in the area—and make suggestions for the\n","best drug, dosage, and duration.\n","Can AI bring personalized tutors to every student?\n","The AI education tools being piloted today are mindblowing because they are tailored to each individual\n","learner. Some of them—like Khanmigo and MATHia—\n","are already remarkable, and they’ll only get better in\n","the years ahead. One of the things that excites me the\n","most about this type of technology is the possibility\n","of localizing it to every student, no matter where\n","they live. For example, a team in Nairobi is working\n","on Somanasi, an AI-based tutor that aligns with the\n","curriculum in Kenya. The name means “learn together”\n","in Swahili, and the tutor has been designed with\n","the cultural context in mind so it feels familiar to the\n","students who use it.\n","Can AI help treat high-risk pregnancies?\n","A woman dies in childbirth every two minutes. That’s\n","a horrifying statistic, but I’m hopeful that AI can help.\n","Last year, I wrote about how AI-powered ultrasounds\n","could help identify pregnancy risks.

If you don’t get\n","enough nutrition during the first two years of life,\n","you don’t develop properly—physically or mentally.\n","By tackling malnutrition, we can reduce one of the\n","biggest contributors to childhood mortality.\n","The causes of malnutrition are a lot more complicated\n","than just not getting enough food. Around 15 years\n","ago, researchers began to suspect that the bacteria\n","that live in your gut—your microbiome—might play\n","a role after noticing that oral childhood vaccines like\n","polio weren’t as effective in places with high rates of\n","malnutrition. It was clear that something prevented\n","them from being absorbed properly.\n","This suspicion was confirmed in 2013, when biologist\n","Jeff Gordon published a landmark study looking at the\n","microbiomes of infant twins in Malawi. It revealed that\n","your microbiome is not just a byproduct of your health\n","but a determinant of it. This was the first big clue that\n","we might be able to reduce malnutrition by changing\n","the gut microbiome.\n","In the last 10 years, we have learned more about the\n","gut microbiome than we learned in the 1,000 years\n","before that. We’ve discovered that the bacteria living\n","in your gut can be in a dysfunctional state that causes\n","inflammation so you can’t absorb nutrients. And we\n","found that you can make the biggest improvements\n","to the gut microbiome if you intervene early.\n","One of the first gut bacteria to appear in human\n","development is called B. infantis. It helps break\n","down the sugars in breastmilk into nutrients the body\n","needs to grow. Breastmilk, in turn, provides food for\n","B. infantis and your entire gut microbiome. It’s a\n","virtuous cycle. But if a baby doesn’t have enough\n","B. infantis bacteria at the beginning, they may not\n","absorb enough nutrients from breastmilk to support\n","the growth of other necessary gut bacteria.\n","It’s almost impossible to overcome this deficit. You\n","can have access to all the nutritious food in the world,\n","and it won’t matter.

If\n","you ask GPT-4 most questions 10,000 times, one of those 10,000 is probably pretty good, but it\n","doesn’t always know which one, and you’d like to get the best response of 10,000 each time, and so\n","that increase in reliability will be important.\n","Customizability and personalization will also be very important. People want very different things\n","out of GPT-4: different styles, different sets of assumptions. We’ll make all that possible, and then\n","also the ability to have it use your own data. The ability to know about you, your email, your\n","calendar, how you like appointments booked, connected to other outside data sources, all of that.\n","Those will be some of the most important areas of improvement.\n","BILL GATES: In the basic algorithm right now, it’s just feed forward, multiply, and so to generate\n","every new word, it’s essentially doing the same thing. I’ll be interested if you ever get to the point\n","where, like in solving a complex math equation, you might have to apply transformations an\n","arbitrary number of times, that the control logic for the reasoning may have to be quite a bit more\n","complex than just what we do today.\n","SAM ALTMAN: At a minimum, it seems like we need some sort of adaptive compute. Right now,\n","we spend the same amount of compute on each token, a dumb one, or figuring out some\n","complicated math.\n","BILL GATES: Yes, when we say, \"Do the Riemann hypothesis …\"\n","SAM ALTMAN: That deserves a lot of compute.\n","BILL GATES: It’s the same compute as saying, \"The.\"\n","SAM ALTMAN: Right, so at a minimum, we’ve got to get that to work. We may need much more\n","sophisticated things beyond it.\n","BILL GATES: You and I were both part of a Senate Education Session, and I was pleased that\n","about 30 senators came to that, and helping them get up to speed, since it’s such a big change agent.\n","I don’t think we could ever say we did too much to draw the politicians in. And yet, when they say,\n","\"Oh, we blew it on social media, we should do better,” – that is an outstanding challenge that there\n","are very negative elements to, in terms of polarization. Even now, I’m not sure how we would deal\n","with that.\n","SAM ALTMAN: I don’t understand why the government was not able to be more effective around\n","social media, but it seems worth trying to understand as a case study for what they’re going to go\n","through now with AI.\n","BILL GATES: It’s a good case study, and when you talk about the regulation, is it clear to you what\n","sort of regulations would be constructed?\n","SAM ALTMAN: I think we’re starting to figure that out. It would be very easy to put way too\n","much regulation on this space. You can look at lots of examples of where that’s happened before.\n","But also, if we are right, and we may turn out not to be, but if we are right, and this technology goes\n","as far as we think it’s going to go, it will impact society, geopolitical balance of power, so many\n","things, that for these, still hypothetical, but future extraordinarily powerful systems – not like GPT4, but something with 100,000 or a million times the compute power of that, we have been\n","socialized in the idea of a global regulatory body that looks at those super-powerful systems, because\n","they do have such global impact. One model we talk about is something like the IAEA. For nuclear\n","energy, we decided the same thing. This needs a global agency of some sort, because of the potential\n","for global impact. I think that could make sense. There will be a lot of shorter term issues, issues of\n","what are these models allowed to say and not say? How do we think about copyright? Different\n","countries are going to think about those differently and that’s fine.\n","BILL GATES: Some people think if there are models that are so powerful, we’re scared of them –\n","the reason nuclear regulation works globally, is basically everyone, at least on the civilian side, wants\n","to share safety practices, and it has been fantastic. When you get over into the weapons side of\n","nuclear, you don’t have that same thing. If the key is to stop the entire world from doing something\n","dangerous, you’d almost want global government, which today for many issues, like climate,\n","terrorism, we see that it’s hard for us to cooperate. People even invoke U.S.-China competition to\n","say why any notion of slowing down would be inappropriate. Isn’t any idea of slowing down, or\n","going slow enough to be careful, hard to enforce?\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes, I think if it comes across as asking for a slowdown, that will be really hard. If\n","it instead says, \"Do what you want, but any compute cluster above a certain extremely high-power\n","threshold” – and given the cost here, we’re talking maybe five in the world, something like that –\n","any cluster like that has to submit to the equivalent of international weapons inspectors. The model\n","there has to be made available for safety audit, pass some tests during training, and before\n","deployment. That feels possible to me. I wasn’t that sure before, but I did a big trip around the\n","world this year, and talked to heads of state in many of the countries that would need to participate\n","in this, and there was almost universal support for it. That’s not going to save us from everything.\n","There are still going to be things that are going to go wrong with much smaller-scale systems, in\n","some cases, probably pretty badly wrong. But I think that can help us with the biggest tier of risks.\n","BILL GATES: I do think AI, in the best case, can help us with some hard problems.\n","SAM ALTMAN: For sure.\n","BILL GATES: Including polarization because potentially that breaks democracy and that would be\n","a super-bad thing. Right now, we’re looking at a lot of productivity improvement from AI, which is\n","overwhelmingly a very good thing. Which areas are you most excited about?\n","SAM ALTMAN: First of all, I always think it’s worth remembering that we’re on this long,\n","continuous curve. Right now, we have AI systems that can do tasks. They certainly can’t do jobs, but\n","they can do tasks, and there’s productivity gain there. Eventually, they will be able to do more things\n","that we think of like a job today, and we will, of course, find new jobs and better jobs. I totally\n","believe that if you give people way more powerful tools, it’s not just that they can work a little faster,\n","they can do qualitatively different things. Right now, maybe we can speed up a programmer 3x.\n","That’s about what we see, and that’s one of the categories that we’re most excited about it. It’s\n","working super-well. But if you make a programmer three times more effective, it’s not just that they\n","can do three times more stuff, it’s that they can – at that higher level of abstraction, using more of\n","their brainpower – they can now think of totally different things. It’s like going from punch cards to\n","higher level languages didn’t just let us program a little faster, it let us do these qualitatively new\n","things. We’re really seeing that.\n","As we look at these next steps of things that can do a more complete task, you can imagine a little\n","agent that you can say, \"Go write this whole program for me, I’ll ask you a few questions along the\n","way, but it won’t just be writing a few functions at a time.” That’ll enable a bunch of new stuff. And\n","then again, it’ll do even more complex stuff. Someday, maybe there’s an AI where you can say, \"Go\n","start and run this company for me.\" And then someday, there’s maybe an AI where you can say,\n","\"Go discover new physics.\" The stuff that we’re seeing now is very exciting and wonderful, but I\n","think it’s worth always putting it in context of this technology that, at least for the next five or ten\n","years, will be on a very steep improvement curve. These are the stupidest the models will ever be.\n","Coding is probably the single area from a productivity gain we’re most excited about today. It’s\n","massively deployed and at scaled usage at this point. Healthcare and education are two things that\n","are coming up that curve that we’re very excited about too.\n","BILL GATES: The thing that is a little daunting is, unlike previous technology improvements, this\n","one could improve very rapidly, and there’s kind of no upper bound. The idea that it achieves\n","human levels on a lot of areas of work, even if it’s not doing unique science, it can do support calls\n","and sales calls. I guess you and I do have some concern, along with this good thing, that it’ll force us\n","to adapt faster than we’ve had to ever before.\n","SAM ALTMAN: That’s the scary part. It’s not that we have to adapt. It’s not that humanity is not\n","super-adaptable. We’ve been through these massive technological shifts, and a massive percentage of\n","the jobs that people do can change over a couple of generations, and over a couple of generations,\n","we seem to absorb that just fine. We’ve seen that with the great technological revolutions of the\n","past. Each technological revolution has gotten faster, and this will be the fastest by far. That’s the\n","part that I find potentially a little scary, is the speed with which society is going to have to adapt, and\n","that the labor market will change.\n","BILL GATES: One aspect of AI is robotics, or blue-collar jobs, when you get hands and feet that\n","are at human-level capability. The incredible ChatGPT breakthrough has kind of gotten us focused\n","on the white-collar thing, which is super appropriate, but I do worry that people are losing the focus\n","on the blue-collar piece. So how do you see robotics?\n","SAM ALTMAN: Super-excited for that. We started robots too early, so we had to put that project\n","on hold. It was hard for the wrong reasons. It wasn’t helping us make progress with the difficult\n","parts of the ML research. We were dealing with bad simulators and breaking tendons and things like\n","that. We also realized more and more over time that we first needed intelligence and cognition, and\n","then we could figure out how to adapt it to physicality. It was easier to start with that with the way\n","we built these language models. But we have always planned to come back to it.\n","We’ve started investing a little bit in robotics companies. On the physical hardware side, there’s\n","finally, for the first time that I’ve ever seen, really exciting new platforms being built there. At some\n","point, we will be able to use our models, as you were saying, with their language understanding and\n","future video understanding, to say, “All right, let’s do amazing things with a robot.”\n","BILL GATES: If the hardware guys who’ve done a good job on legs actually get the arms, hands,\n","fingers piece, and then we couple it, and it’s not ridiculously expensive, that could change the job\n","market for a lot of the blue-collar type work, pretty rapidly.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes. Certainly, the prediction, the consensus prediction, if we rewind seven or ten\n","years, was that the impact was going to be blue-collar work first, white-collar work second, creativity\n","maybe never, but certainly last, because that was magic and human.\n","Obviously, it’s gone exactly the other direction. I think there are a lot of interesting takeaways about\n","why that happened. Creative work, the hallucinations of the GPT models is a feature, not a bug. It\n","lets you discover some new things. Whereas if you’re having a robot move heavy machinery around,\n","you’d better be really precise with that. I think this is just a case of you’ve got to follow where\n","technology goes. You have preconceptions, but sometimes the science doesn’t want to go that way.\n","BILL GATES: So what application on your phone do you use the most?\n","SAM ALTMAN: Slack.\n","BILL GATES: Really?\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes. I wish I could say ChatGPT.\n","BILL GATES: [laughs] Even more than e-mail?\n","SAM ALTMAN: Way more than e-mail. The only thing that I was thinking possibly was iMessages,\n","but yes, more than that.\n","BILL GATES: Inside OpenAI, there’s a lot of coordination going on.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes. What about you?\n","BILL GATES: It’s Outlook. I’m this old-style e-mail guy, either that or the browser, because, of\n","course, a lot of my news is coming through the browser.\n","SAM ALTMAN: I didn’t quite count the browser as an app. It’s possible I use it more, but I still\n","would bet Slack. I’m on Slack all day.\n","BILL GATES: Incredible.\n","BILL GATES: Well, we’ve got a turntable here. I asked Sam, like I have for other guests, to bring\n","one of his favorite records. So, what have we got?\n","SAM ALTMAN: I brought The New Four Seasons - Vivaldi Recomposed by Max Richter. I like music\n","with no words for working. That had the old comfort of Vivaldi and pieces I knew really well, but\n","enough new notes that it was a totally different experience. There are pieces of music that you form\n","these strong emotional attachments to, because you listened to them a lot in a key period of your\n","life. This was something that I listened to a lot while we were starting OpenAI.\n","I think it’s very beautiful music. It’s soaring and optimistic, and just perfect for me for working. I\n","thought the new version is just super great.\n","BILL GATES: Is it performed by an orchestra?\n","SAM ALTMAN: It is. The Chineke! Orchestra.\n","BILL GATES: Fantastic.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Should I play it?\n","BILL GATES: Yes, let’s.\n","[music – “The New Four Seasons – Vivaldi Recomposed: Spring 1” by Max Richter]\n","SAM ALTMAN: This is the intro to the sound we’re going for.\n","[music]\n","BILL GATES: Do you wear headphones?\n","SAM ALTMAN: I do.\n","BILL GATES: Do your colleagues give you a hard time about listening to classical music?\n","SAM ALTMAN: I don’t think they know what I listen to, because I do wear headphones. It’s very\n","hard for me to work in silence. I can do it, but it’s not my natural state.\n","BILL GATES: It’s fascinating. Songs with words, I agree, I would find that distracting, but this is\n","more of a mood type thing.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes, and I have it quiet. I can’t listen to loud music either, but it’s just somehow\n","always what I’ve done.\n","BILL GATES: It’s fantastic. Thanks for bringing it.\n","[music fades]\n","BILL GATES: Now, with AI, to me, if you do get to the incredible capability, AGI, AGI+, there\n","are three things I worry about. One is that a bad guy is in control of the system. If we have good\n","guys who have equally powerful systems that hopefully minimizes that problem. There’s the chance\n","of the system taking control. For some reasons, I’m less concerned about that. I’m glad other people\n","are. The one that sort of befuddles me is human purpose. I get a lot of excitement that, hey, I’m\n","good at working on malaria, and malaria eradication, and getting smart people and applying\n","resources to that. When the machine says to me, \"Bill, go play pickleball, I’ve got malaria eradication.\n","You’re just a slow thinker,\" then it is a philosophically confusing thing. How do you organize\n","society? Yes, we’re going to improve education, but education to do what, if you get to this extreme,\n","which we still have a big uncertainty. For the first time, the chance that might come in the next 20\n","years is not zero.\n","SAM ALTMAN: There’s a lot of psychologically difficult parts of working on the technology, but\n","this is for me, the most difficult, because I also get a lot of satisfaction from that.\n","BILL GATES: You have real value added.\n","SAM ALTMAN: In some real sense, this might be the last hard thing I ever do.\n","BILL GATES: Our minds are so organized around scarcity; scarcity of teachers and doctors and\n","good ideas that, partly, I do wonder if a generation that grows up without that scarcity will find the\n","philosophical notion of how to organize society and what to do. Maybe they’ll come up with a\n","solution. I’m afraid my mind is so shaped around scarcity, I even have a hard time thinking of it.\n","SAM ALTMAN: That’s what I tell myself too, and it’s what I truly believe, that although we are\n","giving something up here, in some sense, we are going to have things that are smarter than us. If we\n","can get into this world of post-scarcity, we will find new things to do. They will feel very different.\n","Maybe instead of solving malaria, you’re deciding which galaxy you like, and what you’re going to do\n","with it. I’m confident we’re never going to run out of problems, and we’re never going to run out of\n","different ways to find fulfilment and do things for each other and understand how we play our\n","human games for other humans in this way that’s going to remain really important. It is going to be\n","different for sure, but I think the only way out is through. We have to go do this thing. It’s going to\n","happen. This is now an unstoppable technological course. The value is too great. And I’m pretty\n","confident, very confident, we’ll make it work, but it does feel like it’s going to be so different.\n","BILL GATES: The way to apply this to certain current problems, like getting kids a tutor and\n","helping to motivate them, or discover drugs for Alzheimer’s, I think it’s pretty clear how to do that.\n","Whether AI can help us go to war less, be less polarized; you’d think as you drive intelligence, and\n","not being polarized kind of is common sense, and not having war is common sense, but I do think a\n","lot of people would be skeptical. I’d love to have people working on the hardest human problems,\n","like whether we get along with each other. I think that would be extremely positive, if we thought\n","the AI could contribute to humans getting along with each other.\n","SAM ALTMAN: I believe that it will surprise us on the upside there. The technology will surprise\n","us with how much it can do. We’ve got to find out and see, but I’m very optimistic. I agree with you,\n","what a contribution that would be.\n","BILL GATES: In terms of equity, technology is often expensive, like a PC or Internet connection,\n","and it takes time to come down in cost. I guess the costs of running these AI systems, it looks pretty\n","good that the cost per evaluation is going to come down a lot?\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s come down an enormous amount already. GPT-3, which is the model we’ve\n","had out the longest and the most time to optimize, in the three and a little bit years that it has been\n","out, we’ve been able to bring the cost down by a factor of 40. For three years’ time, that’s a pretty\n","good start. For 3.5, we’ve brought it down, I would bet, close to 10 at this point. Four is newer, so\n","we haven’t had as much time to bring the cost down there, but we will continue to bring the cost\n","down. I think we are on the steepest curve of cost reduction ever of any technology I know, way\n","better than Moore’s Law. It’s not only that we figured out how to make the models more efficient,\n","but also, as we understand the research better, we can get more knowledge, we can get more ability\n","into a smaller model. I think we are going to drive the cost of intelligence down to so close to zero\n","that it will be this before-and-after transformation for society.\n","Right now, my basic model of the world is cost of intelligence, cost of energy. [Bill laughs] Those are\n","the two biggest inputs to quality of life, particularly for poor people, but overall. If you can drive\n","both of those way down at the same time, the amount of stuff you can have, the amount of\n","improvement you can deliver for people, it’s quite enormous. We are on a curve, at least for\n","intelligence, we will really, really deliver on that promise. Even at the current cost, which again, this\n","is the highest it will ever be and much more than we want, for 20 bucks a month, you get a lot of\n","GPT-4 access, and way more than 20 bucks’ worth of value. We’ve come down pretty far.\n","BILL GATES: What about the competition? Is that kind of a fun thing that many people are\n","working on this all at once?\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s both annoying and motivating and fun. [Bill laughs] I’m sure you’ve felt\n","similarly. It does push us to be better and do things faster. We are very confident in our approach.\n","We have a lot of people that I think are skating to where the puck was, and we’re going to where the\n","puck is going. It feels all right.\n","BILL GATES: I think people would be surprised at how small OpenAI is. How many employees\n","do you have?\n","SAM ALTMAN: About 500, so we’re a little bigger than before.\n","BILL GATES: But that’s tiny. [laughs] By Google, Microsoft, Apple standards –\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s tiny. We have to not only run the research lab, but now we have to run a real\n","business and two products.\n","BILL GATES: The scaling of all your capacities, including talking to everybody in the world, and\n","listening to all those constituencies, that’s got to be fascinating for you right now.\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s very fascinating.\n","BILL GATES: Is it mostly a young company?\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s an older company than average.\n","BILL GATES: Okay.\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s not a bunch of 24-year-old programmers.\n","BILL GATES: It’s true, my perspective is warped, because I’m in my 60s. I see you, and you’re\n","younger, but you’re right. You have a lot in their 40s.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Thirties, 40s, 50s.\n","BILL GATES: It’s not the early Apple, Microsoft, which we were really kids.\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s not, and I’ve reflected on that. I think companies have gotten older in general,\n","and I don’t know quite what to make of that. I think it’s somehow a bad sign for society, but I\n","tracked this at YC. The best founders have trended older over time.\n","BILL GATES: That’s fascinating.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Then in our case, it’s a little bit older than the average, even still.\n","BILL GATES: You got to learn a lot by your role at Y Combinator, helping these companies. I\n","guess that was good training for what you’re doing now. [laughs]\n","SAM ALTMAN: That was super helpful.\n","BILL GATES: Including seeing mistakes.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Totally. OpenAI did a lot of things that are very against the standard YC advice.\n","We took four and a half years to launch our first product. We started the company without any idea\n","of what a product would be. We were not talking to users. I still don’t recommend that for most\n","companies, but having learned the rules and seen them at YC made me feel like I understood when\n","and how and why we could break them. We really did things that were just so different than any\n","other company I’ve seen.\n","BILL GATES: The key was the talent that you assembled, and letting them be focused on the big,\n","big problem, not some near-term revenue thing.\n","SAM ALTMAN: I think Silicon Valley investors would not have supported us at the level we\n","needed, because we had to spend so much capital on the research before getting to the product. We\n","just said, “Eventually the model will be good enough that we know it’s going to be valuable to\n","people.” But we were very grateful for the partnership with Microsoft, because this kind of wayahead-of-revenue investing is not something that the venture capital industry is good at.\n","BILL GATES: No, and the capital costs were reasonably significant, almost at the edge of what\n","venture would ever be comfortable with.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Maybe past.\n","BILL GATES: Maybe past. I give Satya incredible credit for thinking through ‘how do you take this\n","brilliant AI organization, and couple it into the large software company?’ It has been very, very\n","synergistic.\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s been wonderful, yes. You really touched on it, though, and this was\n","something I learned from Y Combinator. We said, we are going to get the best people in the world\n","at this. We are going to make sure that we’re all aligned at where we’re going and this AGI mission.\n","But beyond that, we’re going to let people do their thing. We’re going to realize it’s going to go\n","through some twists and turns and take a while.\n","We had a theory that turned out to be roughly right, but a lot of the tactics along the way turned out\n","to be super wrong. We just tried to follow the science.\n","BILL GATES: I remember going and seeing the demonstration and thinking, okay, what’s the path\n","to revenue on that one? What is that like? In these frenzied times, you’re still holding on to an\n","incredible team.\n","SAM ALTMAN: Yes. Great people really want to work with great colleagues.\n","BILL GATES: That’s an attractive force.\n","SAM ALTMAN: There’s a deep center of gravity there. Also, it sounds so cliche, and every\n","company says it, but people feel the mission so deeply. Everyone wants to be in the room for the\n","creation of AGI.\n","BILL GATES: It must be exciting. I can see the energy when you come up and blow me away\n","again with the demos; I’m seeing new people, new ideas. You’re continuing to move at a really\n","incredible speed.\n","SAM ALTMAN: What’s the piece of advice you give most often?\n","BILL GATES: There are so many different forms of talent. Early in my career, I thought, just pure\n","IQ, like engineering IQ, and of course, you can apply that to financial and sales. That turned out to\n","be so wrong. Building teams where you have the right mix of skills is so important. Getting people\n","to think, for their problem, how do they build that team that has all the different skills, that’s\n","probably the one that I think is the most helpful. Yes, telling kids, you know, math, science is cool, if\n","you like it, but it’s that talent mix that really surprised me.\n","What about you? What advice do you give?\n","SAM ALTMAN: It’s something about how most people are mis-calibrated on risk. They’re afraid\n","to leave the soft, cushy job behind to go do the thing they really want to do, when, in fact, if they\n","don’t do that, they look back at their lives like, “Man, I never went to go start this company I wanted\n","to start, or I never tried to go be an AI researcher.” I think that’s sort of much riskier.\n","Related to that, being clear about what you want to do, and asking people for what you want goes a\n","surprisingly long way. A lot of people get trapped in spending their time in not the way they want to\n","do. Probably the most frequent advice I give is to try to fix that some way or other.\n","BILL GATES: If you can get people into a job where they feel they have a purpose, it’s more fun.\n","Sometimes that’s how they can have gigantic impact.\n","I still love software as much today as I did when Paul Allen and I started Microsoft. But—even though it has improved a lot in the decades since then—in many ways, software is still pretty dumb.\n","\n","To do any task on a computer, you have to tell your device which app to use. You can use Microsoft Word and Google Docs to draft a business proposal, but they can’t help you send an email, share a selfie, analyze data, schedule a party, or buy movie tickets. And even the best sites have an incomplete understanding of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships and a limited ability to use this information to do things for you. That’s the kind of thing that is only possible today with another human being, like a close friend or personal assistant.\n","\n","In the next five years, this will change completely. You won’t have to use different apps for different tasks. You’ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone who’s online will be able to have a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence that’s far beyond today’s technology.\n","\n","This type of software—something that responds to natural language and can accomplish many different tasks based on its knowledge of the user—is called an agent. I’ve been thinking about agents for nearly 30 years and wrote about them in my 1995 book The Road Ahead, but they’ve only recently become practical because of advances in AI.\n","\n","Agents are not only going to change how everyone interacts with computers. They’re also going to upend the software industry, bringing about the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons.\n","\n","\n","\n","A personal assistant for everyone\n","Some critics have pointed out that software companies have offered this kind of thing before, and users didn’t exactly embrace them. (People still joke about Clippy, the digital assistant that we included in Microsoft Office and later dropped.) Why will people use agents?\n","\n","The answer is that they’ll be dramatically better. You’ll be able to have nuanced conversations with them. They will be much more personalized, and they won’t be limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter. Clippy has as much in common with agents as a rotary phone has with a mobile device.\n","\n","An agent will be able to help you with all your activities if you want it to. With permission to follow your online interactions and real-world locations, it will develop a powerful understanding of the people, places, and activities you engage in. It will get your personal and work relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You’ll choose how and when it steps in to help with something or ask you to make a decision.\n","\n","\"Clippy was a bot, not an agent.\"\n","\n","To see the dramatic change that agents will bring, let’s compare them to the AI tools available today. Most of these are bots. They’re limited to one app and generally only step in when you write a particular word or ask for help. Because they don’t remember how you use them from one time to the next, they don’t get better or learn any of your preferences. Clippy was a bot, not an agent.\n","\n","Agents are smarter. They’re proactive—capable of making suggestions before you ask for them. They accomplish tasks across applications. They improve over time because they remember your activities and recognize intent and patterns in your behavior. Based on this information, they offer to provide what they think you need, although you will always make the final decisions.\n","\n","Imagine that you want to plan a trip. A travel bot will identify hotels that fit your budget. An agent will know what time of year you’ll be traveling and, based on its knowledge about whether you always try a new destination or like to return to the same place repeatedly, it will be able to suggest locations. When asked, it will recommend things to do based on your interests and propensity for adventure, and it will book reservations at the types of restaurants you would enjoy. If you want this kind of deeply personalized planning today, you need to pay a travel agent and spend time telling them what you want.\n","\n","The most exciting impact of AI agents is the way they will democratize services that today are too expensive for most people. They’ll have an especially big influence in four areas: health care, education, productivity, and entertainment and shopping.\n","\n","\n","\n","Health care\n","Today, AI’s main role in healthcare is to help with administrative tasks. Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot, for example, can capture audio during an appointment and then write up notes for the doctor to review.\n","\n","The real shift will come when agents can help patients do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment. These agents will also help healthcare workers make decisions and be more productive. (Already, apps like Glass Health can analyze a patient summary and suggest diagnoses for the doctor to consider.) Helping patients and healthcare workers will be especially beneficial for people in poor countries, where many never get to see a doctor at all.\n","\n","These clinician-agents will be slower than others to roll out because getting things right is a matter of life and death. People will need to see evidence that health agents are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes. Of course, humans make mistakes too, and having no access to medical care is also a problem.\n","\n","\"Half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don’t get it.\"\n","\n","Mental health care is another example of a service that agents will make available to virtually everyone. Today, weekly therapy sessions seem like a luxury. But there is a lot of unmet need, and many people who could benefit from therapy don’t have access to it. For example, RAND found that half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don’t get it.\n","\n","AI agents that are well trained in mental health will make therapy much more affordable and easier to get. Wysa and Youper are two of the early chatbots here. But agents will go much deeper. If you choose to share enough information with a mental health agent, it will understand your life history and your relationships. It’ll be available when you need it, and it will never get impatient. It could even, with your permission, monitor your physical responses to therapy through your smart watch—like if your heart starts to race when you’re talking about a problem with your boss—and suggest when you should see a human therapist.\n","\n","\n","\n","Education\n","For decades, I’ve been excited about all the ways that software would make teachers’ jobs easier and help students learn. It won’t replace teachers, but it will supplement their work—personalizing the work for students and liberating teachers from paperwork and other tasks so they can spend more time on the most important parts of the job. These changes are finally starting to happen in a dramatic way.\n","\n","The current state of the art is Khanmigo, a text-based bot created by Khan Academy. It can tutor students in math, science, and the humanities—for example, it can explain the quadratic formula and create math problems to practice on. It can also help teachers do things like write lesson plans. I’ve been a fan and supporter of Sal Khan’s work for a long time and recently had him on my podcast to talk about education and AI.\n","\n","But text-based bots are just the first wave—agents will open up many more learning opportunities.\n","\n","For example, few families can pay for a tutor who works one-on-one with a student to supplement their classroom work. If agents can capture what makes a tutor effective, they’ll unlock this supplemental instruction for everyone who wants it. If a tutoring agent knows that a kid likes Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor’s lyrics to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far richer—with graphics and sound, for example—and more personalized than today’s text-based tutors.\n","\n","\n","\n","Productivity\n","There’s already a lot of competition in this field. Microsoft is making its Copilot part of Word, Excel, Outlook, and other services. Google is doing similar things with Assistant with Bard and its productivity tools. These copilots can do a lot—such as turn a written document into a slide deck, answer questions about a spreadsheet using natural language, and summarize email threads while representing each person’s point of view.\n","\n","Agents will do even more. Having one will be like having a person dedicated to helping you with various tasks and doing them independently if you want. If you have an idea for a business, an agent will help you write up a business plan, create a presentation for it, and even generate images of what your product might look like. Companies will be able to make agents available for their employees to consult directly and be part of every meeting so they can answer questions.\n","\n","\"If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you.\"\n","\n","Whether you work in an office or not, your agent will be able to help you in the same way that personal assistants support executives today. If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you. If you tell it you’d like to catch up with your old college roommate, it will work with their agent to find a time to get together, and just before you arrive, it will remind you that their oldest child just started college at the local university.\n","\n","\n","\n","Entertainment and shopping\n","Already, AI can help you pick out a new TV and recommend movies, books, shows, and podcasts. Likewise, a company I’ve invested in, recently launched Pix, which lets you ask questions (“Which Robert Redford movies would I like and where can I watch them?”) and then makes recommendations based on what you’ve liked in the past. Spotify has an AI-powered DJ that not only plays songs based on your preferences but talks to you and can even call you by name.\n","\n","Agents won’t simply make recommendations; they’ll help you act on them. If you want to buy a camera, you’ll have your agent read all the reviews for you, summarize them, make a recommendation, and place an order for it once you’ve made a decision. If you tell your agent that you want to watch Star Wars, it will know whether you’re subscribed to the right streaming service, and if you aren’t, it will offer to sign you up. And if you don’t know what you’re in the mood for, it will make customized suggestions and then figure out how to play the movie or show you choose.\n","\n","You’ll also be able to get news and entertainment that’s been tailored to your interests. CurioAI, which creates a custom podcast on any subject you ask about, is a glimpse of what’s coming.\n","\n","\n","\n","A shock wave in the tech industry\n","In short, agents will be able to help with virtually any activity and any area of life. The ramifications for the software business and for society will be profound.\n","\n","In the computing industry, we talk about platforms—the technologies that apps and services are built on. Android, iOS, and Windows are all platforms. Agents will be the next platform.\n","\n","\"To create a new app or service, you'll just tell your agent what you want.\"\n","\n","To create a new app or service, you won’t need to know how to write code or do graphic design. You’ll just tell your agent what you want. It will be able to write the code, design the look and feel of the app, create a logo, and publish the app to an online store. OpenAI’s launch of GPTs this week offers a glimpse into the future where non-developers can easily create and share their own assistants.\n","\n","Agents will affect how we use software as well as how it’s written. They’ll replace search sites because they’ll be better at finding information and summarizing it for you. They’ll replace many e-commerce sites because they’ll find the best price for you and won’t be restricted to just a few vendors. They’ll replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity apps. Businesses that are separate today—search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, productivity software—will become one business.\n","\n","I don’t think any single company will dominate the agents business--there will be many different AI engines available. Today, agents are embedded in other software like word processors and spreadsheets, but eventually they’ll operate on their own. Although some agents will be free to use (and supported by ads), I think you’ll pay for most of them, which means companies will have an incentive to make agents work on your behalf and not an advertiser’s. If the number of companies that have started working on AI just this year is any indication, there will be an exceptional amount of competition, which will make agents very inexpensive.\n","\n","But before the sophisticated agents I’m describing become a reality, we need to confront a number of questions about the technology and how we’ll use it. I’ve written before about the issues that AI raises, so I’ll focus specifically on agents here.\n","\n","\n","\n","The technical challenges\n","Nobody has figured out yet what the data structure for an agent will look like. To create personal agents, we need a new type of database that can capture all the nuances of your interests and relationships and quickly recall the information while maintaining your privacy. We are already seeing new ways of storing information, such as vector databases, that may be better for storing data generated by machine learning models.\n","\n","Another open question is about how many agents people will interact with. Will your personal agent be separate from your therapist agent and your math tutor? If so, when will you want them to work with each other and when should they stay in their lanes?\n","\n","“If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone.”\n","\n","How will you interact with your agent? Companies are exploring various options including apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. All of these are possibilities, but I think the first big breakthrough in human-agent interaction will be earbuds. If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone. (“Your flight is delayed. Do you want to wait, or can I help rebook it?”) If you want, it will monitor sound coming into your ear and enhance it by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech that’s hard to hear, or making it easier to understand someone who’s speaking with a heavy accent.\n","\n","There are other challenges too. There isn’t yet a standard protocol that will allow agents to talk to each other. The cost needs to come down so agents are affordable for everyone. It needs to be easier to prompt the agent in a way that will give you the right answer. We need to prevent hallucinations, especially in areas like health where accuracy is super-important, and make sure that agents don’t harm people as a result of their biases. And we don’t want agents to be able to do things they’re not supposed to. (Although I worry less about rogue agents than about human criminals using agents for malign purposes.)\n","\n","\n","\n","Privacy and other big questions\n","As all of this comes together, the issues of online privacy and security will become even more urgent than they already are. You’ll want to be able to decide what information the agent has access to, so you’re confident that your data is shared with only people and companies you choose.\n","\n","But who owns the data you share with your agent, and how do you ensure that it’s being used appropriately? No one wants to start getting ads related to something they told their therapist agent. Can law enforcement use your agent as evidence against you? When will your agent refuse to do something that could be harmful to you or someone else? Who picks the values that are built into agents?\n","\n","There’s also the question of how much information your agent should share. Suppose you want to see a friend: If your agent talks to theirs, you don’t want it to say, \"Oh, she’s seeing other friends on Tuesday and doesn’t want to include you.” And if your agent helps you write emails for work, it will need to know that it shouldn’t use personal information about you or proprietary data from a previous job.\n","\n","Many of these questions are already top-of-mind for the tech industry and legislators. I recently participated in a forum on AI with other technology leaders that was organized by Sen. Chuck Schumer and attended by many U.S. senators. We shared ideas about these and other issues and talked about the need for lawmakers to adopt strong legislation.\n","\n","But other issues won’t be decided by companies and governments. For example, agents could affect how we interact with friends and family. Today, you can show someone that you care about them by remembering details about their life—say, their birthday. But when they know your agent likely reminded you about it and took care of sending flowers, will it be as meaningful for them?\n","\n","In the distant future, agents may even force humans to face profound questions about purpose. Imagine that agents become so good that everyone can have a high quality of life without working nearly as much. In a future like that, what would people do with their time? Would anyone still want to get an education when an agent has all the answers? Can you have a safe and thriving society when most people have a lot of free time on their hands?\n","\n","But we’re a long way from that point. In the meantime, agents are coming. In the next few years, they will utterly change how we live our lives, online and off.\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Tokenization\n","import re\n","\n","def tokenize(text):\n","
